# Zaycare-Project
Project about building a cricket team:-

This is the first draft of my project.
This is a fuctioning website as of now but I'm currently working on the css part. I've used HTML, CSS, Javascript to create this project.
I'm also trying to look into React to create a similar website.
I will update the project once I'm done with the css.

TIME TAKEN: 3 days to complete the initial draft. I apologize for not uploading this sooner since I was working on the CSS.

INSTRUCTIONS: 
1. index.html is the primary project file which you can open in a web browser.
1. Tick the checkbox against the Players you want to select.
2. You can select upto 3 Bastsmen, 3 Bowlers, 1 Wicket-Keeper and 2 All-Rounders. If you try to select more players than the required players, an alert will pop up showing you can't exceed a certain number of players.
3. After selecting the players, you can press the submit button which will show your selected players below.
